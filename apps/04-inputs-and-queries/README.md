# Inputs & Queries

Oh no! A developer on your team started their summer holiday, but the feature they were working on was not yet finished. However, the dealine is approaching fast and the team really wants to ship this feature on time.

You are the chosen one to put your skills to work and finish the implementation.

## Run app

```bash
pnpm start inputs-and-queries
```

## Instructions

The goal for this exercise is to finish a books carousel implementation, using **both** `input()` and `viewChild()`.

_Hint:_ your colleague left some meaningful `TODO` comments in the code...
