# Fun with Signals

You thought PokÃ©mon was just for kids? Well, maybe you're right but let's just have some fun with them while we implement a search app for PokÃ©mon cards ðŸ”´âšª.

## Run app

```bash
pnpm start fun-with-signals
```

## Instructions

- Have a look at the code first. Then type something in the serach box and notice how the URL query param is automatically updated.
- Implement the missing parts, to show the pokemon card search results in a grid.
- Each card should show a tooltip (`title` attribute) with the pokemon name, subtypes, HP and name of the set. Example: `Gengar V - Basic/V/Single Strike - HP: 210 - Fusion Strike`
