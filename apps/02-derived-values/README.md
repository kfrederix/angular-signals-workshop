# Derived values

Let's see how we can create _reactive_ derived values.

## Run app

```bash
pnpm start derived-values
```

## Instructions

This app allows the user to fill in their full name. We want the app to show the users' initials, first name and last name.

### Example

When user types "George Raymond Richard Martin", the app should show:

- first name: George
- last name: Martin
- initials: G.R.R.M.
