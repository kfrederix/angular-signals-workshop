# Angular Signals Workshop

Learn all about Angular Signals by solving some fun problems.

## What is this?

This is an Nx monorepo containing several mini Angular apps. Each of these apps serves as a starting point for solving a particular problem. The goal of these exercises is to become familiar with concepts and patterns involving Angular signals.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need Node version >= 20 installed on your system, plus `pnpm`.

The easiest, and preferred, way to install `pnpm` is using corepack: https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack.

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Slides

Hosted version of the slides can be [viewed directly here](https://kfrederix.github.io/angular-signals-workshop/).

It's also possible to run the slides locally, in dev mode.
To do that, run this command:

```bash
pnpm start slides
```

## Exercises

This workshop was designed in a way that you can use the slides to guide you.

By following the slides, you will get a nice learning experience. It will alternate between theoritical parts, and hands-on exercises. The slides will tell you when it's time to start an exercise ðŸ˜Š.

Further instuctions for each exercise can be found in the `README.md` file for each app:

1. [Basics](./apps/01-basics/)
2. [Derived Values](./apps/02-derived-values/)
3. [Side Effects](./apps/03-side-effects/)
4. [Inputs & Queries](./apps/04-inputs-and-queries/)
5. [Fun with Signals](./apps/05-fun-with-signals/)


I hope you will enjoy this!

P.S. Solutions can also be found in a separate branch. These are only 1 way to solve the problems. If you found another solution, great! It might be just as good or even better than mine.
